# Plotscaper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Plotscaper is an R package designed for making interactive figures geared towards data exploration. All plots in a `plotscaper` figure support linked highlighting by default, and include a wide variety of other interactions, including switching representation, changing parameters, zooming, panning, and reordering.

## Quick start

To get started, install `plotscaper` with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
devtools::install_github("bartonicek/plotscape/packages/plotscaper")
```

Next, open up RStudio and run the following code:

```{r}
library(plotscaper)

layout <- matrix(c(
  1, 1, 2, 3,
  1, 1, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 7, 7
), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city") |>
  add_histogram(c("sqft")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("beds", "baths")) |>
  add_histogram2d(c("sqft", "price")) |>
  add_notes() |>
  add_parcoords(names(sacramento)) |>
  set_layout(layout)
```

In your viewer, you should now see something like the image above, however, your version should be fully interactive (the above image is a static snapshot is because `README.md` does not allow JavaScript, unfortunately).

Try moving your mouse somewhere over the big scatterplot on the top left, clicking and dragging to select some points. You should see the corresponding cases highlight across all the other plots! 

There are many other ways interacting with `plotscaper` figures. The list includes:

- Assigning selected cases to persistent groups
- Changing the size of objects
- Increasing/decreasing the opacity (alpha)
- Panning
- Manipulating parameters such as histogram binwidth and anchor
- Modifying continuous axis limits
- Sorting and reordering discrete axes
- Changing the size of the individual plots

Click on the question mark in the top right of the figure to see the list plus the corresponding key/mouse bindings.

## Anatomy of a `plotscaper` figure

There are quite a few things happening in the code of the figure above. Let's break it down piece by piece.

First, whenever we want to create a `plotscaper` figure, we need to set up a scene. A scene is a kind of context into which all plots get placed. 

To set up a scene, run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
set_scene(data = sacramento)
```

where `data` is a `data.frame` object. Here we're using the Sacramento housing dataset from the `caret` package.

On its own, however, a scene doesn't do anything. To create an interactive figure, we need to populate it with plots. That's what the various `add_*plot` functions are for:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city")
```

As you can see above, this creates a simple interactive figure with a scatterplot and a barplot. Not much more to it. We specify which variables we want to plot by a simple character vector of their names.

Each `plotscaper` figure is a `htmlwidgets` widget, which means that, whenever we print the underlying object, `htmlwidgets` generates and packages up the underlying HTML and sends it to the RStudio viewer (which is a kind of Web browser). Thus, if we do something like this, nothing happens:

```{r}
s <- set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city")
```

However, printing the `s` object generates the figure:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
s
```

We can use this fact to generate figures programmatically using R. For example, here's how we could create an interactive scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) of the `Iris` dataset:

```{r}

iris_smaller <- iris[, 1:3]
keys <- names(iris_smaller)

s <- set_scene(iris_smaller)

for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    # Add a scatterplot if row & column no.'s different
    if (i != j) s <- s |> add_scatterplot(c(keys[i], keys[j]))
    # Add a histogram if row & column no.'s match
    else s <- s |> add_histogram(c(keys[i])) 
  }
}

s
```

### Layout

We can control the figure layout by using the `set_layout` function. This works similar to the `layout` function from the `graphics` package. We give it a matrix of numeric values representing the plot ids, and the figure automatically resizes the plots based on how many equal-sized rectangles in a grid each plot takes up. 

Here's how we can create a figure with large scatterplot on the top-left, a tall histogram on the right-hand side, a short wide histogram on the bottom, and a small section for notes (not-(e)-plot, pardon the pun) on the bottom-right:

```{r}

layout <- matrix(c(
  1, 1, 2,
  1, 1, 2,
  3, 3, 4
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("sqft", "price")) |>
  add_histogram("price") |>
  add_histogram("sqft") |>
  add_notes() |>
  set_layout(layout)

```

(it doesn't matter in which order we call the `add_*` and `set_layout` function, as all the important stuff happens when the HTML for the figure gets generated)

The individual plots can still be resized by pressing and holding the `S` key and then 
dragging a widget in the bottom right of the plot area. Note however that this may result in gaps in the layout. 

## Reducers

> This section goes into the deeper properties of `plotscaper`, 

One of the main goals of the `plotscaper` project is to explore the ways of combining graphical objects and statistics to produce interactive visualizations that behave in some specific, consistent ways. Phew, that was a mouthful.

A key idea for achieving this is the concept of reducers. A reducer is a pair of functions: 

- An *initial function* (`initialfn`) which takes no arguments and produces some value (also known as a "thunk").
- A *reduce function* (`reducefn`) which combines two values to produce a new one. 

Further, `initialfn` and `reducefn` must have the following two properties:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reducefn(a, initialfn()) === a                                  # Unitality
reducefn(reducefn(a, b), c) === reducefn(a, reducefn(b, c))     # Associativity
```

If you're familiar with how R's higher-order `Reduce` function, `reduce` / `fold` functions from other programming languages, or if you know something about [Monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid), then this should be fairly familiar. If this all looks weird to you, don't worry, it looked weird to me the first time I saw it too. 

The important thing to grasp is that some functions that behave this way and others don't. For example, summation behaves like this:

```{r}
1 + 0 == 1
(1 + 2) + 3 == 1 + (2 + 3)
```

multiplication does as well:

```{r}
10 * 1 == 10
(10 * 20) * 30 == 10 * (20 * 30)
```

concatenation of strings too:

```{r}
paste0("a", "") == "a"
paste0(paste0("a", "b"), "c") == paste0("a", paste0("b", "c"))
```

but, for example, exponentiation does not:

```{r}
(2)^1 == 1                    # This is okay
(2 ^ 3) ^ 4 == 2 ^ (3 ^ 4)    # But this is not!
```

In `plotscaper`, we use reducers to compute the statistics underlying the visualization. It is necessary for them to have the above properties because otherwise otherwise some key graphical operations such as stacking would not work.

But, I hear you say: "why is stacking important? can't we just use dodging?" I would argue that in the context of interactive graphics, dodging is not a good idea, for several reasons. If we want our plots to support bi-directional linked selection, then every graphical object needs to be able to: 

1. Be selected
2. Display selected parts
3. (do both in a sensible manner)

This can be a problem with dodging. Specifically, since the parts of each object are independent, linked selection can cause the overall shape of the plot to vary wildly. For example, in a dodged barplot, linked selection can cause bars to shrink and grow erratically, and flicker in and out of existence. Further, since the height of the tallest dodged sub-bar can change with selection, we may have to change axis limits as well. 

In contrast, in a stacked barplot, the overall shape of the plot stays constant throughout linked selection. This is because the heights of the stacked sub-bars add up to the height of the whole bars:

```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

set.seed(12345)
mtcars$cyl1 <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$cyl2 <- factor(sample(mtcars$cyl))
mtcars$cyl3 <- factor(sample(mtcars$cyl))

p0 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(am)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), expand = c(0.2, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 2), expand = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  guides(fill = "none") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

p <- list()

for (i in 1:3) {
  p[[i]] <- p0 + geom_bar(aes(fill = .data[[paste0("cyl", i)]]), width = 0.75)
  p[[3 + i]] <- p0 + geom_bar(aes(fill = .data[[paste0("cyl", i)]]), 
                              position = "dodge")
}

(p[[1]] + p[[2]] + p[[3]]) / (p[[4]] + p[[5]] + p[[6]])
```

> Notice that in the top row, the overall shape of the bars remains the same, whereas in the bottom row it changes drastically. Also notice that in the bottom row, the upper y-axis limit changes from plot to plot. Finally, look at the bars in the middle bottom plot belonging to the category 1 - they are wider because the bar representing the orange subcategory is missing.

I haven't found any good citation for this so far, but from my own experience I would argue that interactive figures that change less with interaction are more visually appealing and easier to read than figures that change a lot. Also, from the [Gestalt principles of visual perception](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles), we know that if we want to group things visually together, we place them in a common, closed region. This is what stacking does.

However, for stacking to produce meaningful statistics, the summaries we are stacking need to be *stackable*. For example, stacking counts and sums produces bars which show a valid overall statistics, however, stacking means does not. For example, the height of the bars in the following plot is completely meaningless:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p0 + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = mpg, fill = cyl1), stat = "summary", fun = "mean",
           position = "stack") + # Just to highlight that we are, indeed, stacking 
  scale_y_continuous()
  
```

> What kind of statistic is a sum of means?

And this is precisely what the definition of reducers guarantees. 

```{r}

library(htmlwidgets)

reducer1 <- reducer(
  name = "max",
  initialfn = JS("() => -Infinity"),
  reducefn = JS("(a, b) => Math.max(a, b)")
)

set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("sqft", "price")) |>
  add_barplot(c("city", "price"), 
              options(reducer = reducer1))

```

## Performance

While `plotscaper` wasn't designed specifically for performance, it can perform fairly well on moderately-sized datasets (thanks largely to the work of the super smart people who optimize the JavaScript engines like V8, rather than any real ability on my part). 

For example, if you want to put it to a stress test, try creating a figure with the entire `diamonds` dataset from the `ggplot2` package:

```{r}
set_scene(ggplot2::diamonds) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("carat", "price")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("cut", "color")) |>
  add_barplot(c("color"))

```

With 50,000 cases, dragging to select points in the scatterplot becomes a bit sluggish on my machine, but still fast enough to give the figure an "interactive" rather than "slideshow" feel. Your mileage may vary. Note that most of the slowdown is due to rendering rather than computation - removing the scatterplot with its 50,000 points makes the interactions a lot snappier.

Also, frustratingly, there seems to be a small slowdown when interacting with the figure in the RStudio viewer panel rather than in the browser window. Interestingly, this does not seem to be related to the dataset size. I'm not very familiar with the RStudio internals and have no idea why this might be, but for now, if you want faster interactions I recommend just opening up a browser window, e.g. by clicking the icon in the top right of the viewer:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/browser.png")
```
  
(if you know the reason behind this slowdown, please email me at abar435@aucklanduni.ac.nz)

Anyway, if you need fast figures with larger datasets, I recommend:

- Run the figure in the browser rather than viewer
- Use plots which summarize the data (e.g. barplots, 2D histograms), 
rather than plots which show all of the datapoints
- If everything else fails, subsample the data
