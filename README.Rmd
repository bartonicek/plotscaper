# Plotscaper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Plotscaper is an R package designed for making interactive figures geared towards data exploration. All plots in a `plotscaper` figure support linked highlighting by default, and include a wide variety of other interactions, including switching representation, changing parameters, zooming, panning, and reordering.

## Quick start

To get started, install `plotscaper` with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
devtools::install_github("bartonicek/plotscape/packages/plotscaper")
```

Next, open up RStudio and run the following code:

```{r}
library(plotscaper)

layout <- matrix(c(
  1, 1, 2, 3,
  1, 1, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 7, 7
), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city") |>
  add_histogram(c("sqft")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("beds", "baths")) |>
  add_histogram2d(c("sqft", "price")) |>
  add_notes() |>
  add_parcoords(names(sacramento)) |>
  set_layout(layout)
```

In your viewer, you should now see something like the image above, however, your version should be fully interactive (the above image is a static snapshot is because `README.md` does not allow JavaScript, unfortunately).

Try moving your mouse somewhere over the big scatterplot on the top left, clicking and dragging to select some points. You should see the corresponding cases highlight across all the other plots! 

There are many other ways interacting with the figure. Click on the question mark button in the top right of the figure to see a list of the available options.

## Anatomy of a `plotscaper` figure

There are quite a few things happening in the code of the figure above. Let's break it down piece by piece.

First, whenever we want to create a `plotscaper` figure, we need to set up a scene. A scene is a kind of context into which all plots get placed. 

To set up a scene, run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
set_scene(data = sacramento)
```

where `data` is a `data.frame` object. Here we're using the Sacramento housing dataset from the `caret` package.

On its own, however, a scene doesn't do anything. To create an interactive figure, we need to populate it with plots. That's what the various `add_*plot` functions are for:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city")
```

As you can see above, this creates a simple interactive figure with a scatterplot and a barplot. Not much more to it. We specify which variables we want to plot by a simple character vector of their names.

Each `plotscaper` figure is a `htmlwidgets` widget, which means that, whenever we print the underlying object, `htmlwidgets` generates and packages up the underlying HTML and sends it to the RStudio viewer (which is a kind of Web browser). Thus, if we do something like this, nothing happens:

```{r}
s <- set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("longitude", "latitude")) |>
  add_barplot("city")
```

However, printing the `s` object generates the figure:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
s
```

We can use this fact to generate figures programmatically using R. For example, here's how we could create an interactive scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) of the `Iris` dataset:

```{r}

iris_smaller <- iris[, 1:3]
keys <- names(iris_smaller)

s <- set_scene(iris_smaller)

for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    # Add a scatterplot if row & column # different
    if (i != j) s <- s |> add_scatterplot(c(keys[i], keys[j]))
    # Add a histogram if row & column # match
    else s <- s |> add_histogram(c(keys[i])) 
  }
}

s
```

### Layout

We can control the figure layout by using the `set_layout` function. This works similar to the `layout` function from the `graphics` package, in that we give it a matrix of numeric values representing the plot ids, and the figure automatically resizes the plots based on how many equal-sized rectangles in a grid each plot takes up. For example, here's how we can create a figure with large scatterplot on the top-left, a tall histogram on the right-hand side, a short wide histogram on the bottom, and a small section for notes on the bottom-right:

```{r}

layout <- matrix(c(
  1, 1, 2,
  1, 1, 2,
  3, 3, 4
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

set_scene(sacramento) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("sqft", "price")) |>
  add_histogram("price") |>
  add_histogram("sqft") |>
  add_notes() |>
  set_layout(layout)

```

(it doesn't matter in which order we call the `add_*` and `set_layout` function, as all the important stuff happens when the HTML for the figure gets generated)

## Performance

While `plotscaper` wasn't designed specifically for performance, it can perform fairly well on moderately-sized datasets (thanks largely to the work of the super smart people who optimize the JavaScript engines like V8, rather than any real ability on my part). 

For example, if you want to put it to a stress test, try creating a figure with the entire `diamonds` dataset from the `ggplot2` package:

```{r}
set_scene(ggplot2::diamonds) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("carat", "price")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("cut", "color")) |>
  add_barplot(c("color"))

```

With 50,000 cases, brushing the scatterplot is a bit sluggish on my machine, but still fast enough to feel like "an interactive figure" rather than "a slideshow". Your mileage may vary. Note however, that most of the slowdown is due to rendering rather than computation - i.e. removing the scatterplot with its 50,000 points makes the interactions a lot snappier.

Also, frustratingly, there seems to a small slowdown when interacting with the figure in the RStudio viewer panel rather than in the browser window. Interestingly, this does not seem to be related to the dataset size. I'm not very familiar with the RStudio internals and have no idea why this might be, but for now, if you want faster interactions I recommend just opening up the browser, e.g. by clicking the icon in the top right of the viewer:

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| out-width: 75%
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/browser.png")
```
