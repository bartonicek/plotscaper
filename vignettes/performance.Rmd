## Performance

While performance wasn't a number one concern for `plotscaper`, I found it can actually perform fairly well on moderately-sized data sets (thanks to the work of the very smart people who have optimized JavaScript engines like V8). 

If you want to put `plotscaper` under a stress test, try creating a figure with the entire `diamonds` dataset from the `ggplot2` package:

(the figure below might take a bit to load, be patient)

```{r}
library(plotscaper)

set_scene(ggplot2::diamonds) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("carat", "price")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("cut", "color")) |>
  add_barplot(c("color"))
```

On my machine, I found that the figure with its 50,000 cases becomes a bit sluggish, but still fast enough to feel "interactive" rather than a "slideshow". Your mileage may vary, and that goes double for Github pages (where you might be viewing the figure right now). 

Note that most of the slowdown is due to rendering rather than computation. In the scatterplot, we have to draw each of the 50,000 points each time linked selection happens, hence why it takes long. Same goes for parallel coordinates plots. If instead you only use plots which are aggregate summaries of the data, (e.g. barplot, histogram, fluctuation diagram, etc...) then the figure should be a lot faster.

Finally, one thing that's frustrating is that there seems to be a small slowdown when interacting with the figure in the RStudio Viewer rather than directly in the browser (Chrome). This does not seem to be related to the dataset size. I'm not very familiar with the RStudio internals and have no idea why this might be, but for now, if you want snappier interactions I recommend just opening up a browser window, e.g. by clicking the icon in the top right of the viewer:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
library(screenshot)
library(magick)

# Code to take the screenshot of the current page
set_scene(ggplot2::diamonds) |>
  add_scatterplot(c("carat", "price")) |>
  add_fluctplot(c("cut", "color")) |>
  add_barplot(c("color"))

# sc <- screenshot()
image <- image_read(sc)
image2 <- image_crop(image, geometry_area(800, 600, 1390, 390))

image3 <- image_draw(image2)
points(290, 45, cex = 10, col = "red", lwd = 5)
dev.off()

image_write(image3, "./man/figures/browser.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/browser.png")

```

(if you know the reason behind this slowdown and/or how to fix it, please email me at abar435@aucklanduni.ac.nz)

Anyway, if you need fast figures with larger data sets, I recommend taking some of the following steps:

- Run the figure in the browser rather than the RStudio viewer
- Use plots which summarize the data (e.g. barplots, 2D histograms), 
rather than plots which show all of the data points
- Take a subsample the data
