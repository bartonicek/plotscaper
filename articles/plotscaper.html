<p>There are many other ways interacting with <code>plotscaper</code>
figures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zooming and panning</li>
<li>Changing the size of objects</li>
<li>Increasing/decreasing the opacity (alpha)</li>
<li>Manipulating parameters such as histogram binwidth and anchor</li>
<li>Modifying axis limits and ordering discrete axes</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, many of these interactions can either be done manually,
by interacting with the figure (client-side), or programmatically, by
calling functions from inside a running R session (“server-side”).</p>

<h2 id="the-scene-and-the-schema">The scene and the schema<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-scene-and-the-schema"></a>
</h2>
<p>To take full advantage of <code>plotscaper</code>, you need to
understand two core functions: <code>create_schema</code> and
<code>render</code>. We’ll explore this on the example of the
<code>penguins</code> data set <span class="citation">(Horst, Hill, and
Gorman 2020)</span>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-a-schema">Creating a schema<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-schema"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>create_schema</code> function initializes a <em>schema</em>
- a sort of a recipe which we can use to define the figure. Like in
other data visualization packages, we build up the schema step-by-step,
by calling functions that append additional information to it:</p>

<p>The schema then is really just a list of messages:</p>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; plotscaper schema:</span></span>

</h2>
<p>Whereas the <code>create_schema</code> merely initializes a recipe
which is just a regular R object (a <code>list</code>), the
<code>render</code> function renders the recipe into an
<code>htmlwidgets</code> widget, <em>and</em>, if inside a running R
session, it also launches an <code>httpuv</code> server for direct
communication between the R session and the figure.</p>
<p>We can use (mostly) the same functions to modify schema (created by
call to <code>create_schema</code>) and scene (created by call to
<code>render</code>). The difference is that while calling functions
with a schema as the first argument merely appends the corresponding
message to the recipe, calling functions with scene immediately sends a
message to the figure via the server.</p>
<p>That is, while the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="va">scene</span></span>
<span><span class="va">scene</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>causes two full re-renders, the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># NOT RUN</span></span>

<p>causes only one render (if inside a running R session).</p>
<p>In other words, <code>plotscaper</code> functions such as
<code>add_*</code>, <code>set_selected</code>, and
<code>set_scale</code> behave differently based on whether we call them
on scene or schema:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Schema</strong>: calling a function lazily appends to a list
of messages that will get executed in the future, when the schema is
rendered</li>
<li>
<strong>Scene</strong>: calling a function immediately sends a
message to the scene and mutates its state</li>
</ul>
<p>The second method only works if we are in an interactive R session
because we need a server to communicate with the figure.</p>
<p>This is why running the following code (while the document you’re
reading is being knitted) throws an error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/interactive.html" class="external-link">interactive</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></span>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; Error: You can only send messages to scene from within an interactive R session</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we knit an RMarkdown document, we generate a static HTML file.
By default, we cannot communicate with this file since it’s just a big
blob of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To only way to change the file is to
rewrite it. Thus, in RMarkdown, we can really only really write the
schema and <code>render</code> - we can’t do anything with the figure
once it’s been rendered.</p>
<p>In contrast, inside an interactive R session, we can launch a server
that will listen and respond to messages from the R session and send
them to the figure (and also send messages from the figure back to the R
session - this is done via WebSockets).</p>
<p>This also means there are some functions that it only make sense to
use inside a running R session. For example, the following functions
query the selection status of the figure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">scene</span> <span class="op">|&gt;</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/selected_cases.html">selected_cases</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="va">scene</span> <span class="op">|&gt;</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/assigned_cases.html">assigned_cases</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That means that you can, for example, render a figure, select some
cases of the data using a mouse, and then call
<code>scene |&gt; selected_cases()</code> to get the row indices of
those cases. This doesn’t really make sense when writing a schema - the
only way to select cases is via an explicit call to
<code>select_cases</code>, so we would be querying cases that we have
already specified before.</p>
<p>Likewise, there are functions such as <code>pop_plot</code> and
<code>remove_plot</code> which can be used to remove plots from scene.
These don’t really make sense to use while writing a schema - if you
know that you don’t want a specific plot, you can just delete the call
to add it to the recipe. However, they <em>do</em> make sense when
interacting with a scene inside a running R session. Perhaps you found
some interesting trend in your data and want to see if it holds in other
plots, but you’re running out of space in the viewer - you can
<code>pop_plot</code> to remove the last plot and <code>add_*</code> to
add a new plot, all the while keeping the rest of the state of the
figure intact!</p>

<p>Since the schema is lazy, we can use it to generate figures

<p>However, having to do this for all nine plots might quickly get
tedious.</p>
<p>As such, there are different reasons why you might want to do
something using a scene, a schema, or some combination of both. If
you’re writing an RMarkdown document, you don’t really have a choice -
you can’t do anything to a scene once it’s rendered.</p>
<p>Inside an interactive R session, you have more options. You can
decide you first want to create a highly customized schema and only then
start interacting with the figure live. Or you can just immediately fire
off <code>scene &lt;- create_schema(data) |&gt; render()</code> and do
everything interactively.</p>
<p>Each approach has some advantages and some disadvantages. With the
schema way, you can always re-create most of the state, so if you mess
up and need to go back, you can just print <code>scene</code> and you’re
good to go. With the interactive scene way, you’re more flexible and you
have the immediate feedback in seeing how the figure changes in front of
you, however, it may be more difficult to recover some state if there
are many intermediate steps.</p>
