However, ’s one important argument applied function call, ggplot2 default don’t see unless specify explicitly: using using fill aesthetic geom_bar (well geoms), ggplot2 applies stack transformation default. case bars, transformation stacks bars vertically top , effectively summing heights coloured sub-bars. herein lies problem: height stacked bars represent now? Since stacking bars effectively summing underlying statistic, whole bar now represents sum group averages. meaningful summary statistic - “sum averages” quantity many people care know interpret. kind problem can easily trip data visualization rookie, good number data visualization researchers warned : “Stacking useful sum amounts represented individual stacked bars meaningful amount” (Wilke 2019, 52). “[…] important element’s size used display statistic, statistic must summable. Stacking bars represent counts, sums, percentages fine, stacked bar chart bars show average values generally meaningless.” (Wills 2011, 112). Alright, might say, sum averages, since summing sums fine, taking average averages? Unfortunately, correct either - mean group means grand mean: researchers warned : “[…] ensure aggregate statistics always computed input data, users inadvertantly compute e.g., averages averages, can easily lead misinterpretation.” (Wu 2022) ? ’re familiar ggplot2, may thinking one handy solution right now: instead stacking bars, let’s use dodging plot side side:  works well static graphics. However, interactive graphics, dodging several issues. Take look following two rows plots:  rows, represent data; top row use stacking, bottom row use dodging. can imagine barplots produced linked selection, dark-blue bars representing selected cases cases selected move left right. Notice top row, overall contour plot remains constant even number selected cases changes: always tall left bar, tall right bar, short middle bar, heights highlighted dark-blue sections fluctuate. true dodging. dodging, since plot selected non-selected cases side--side, selection can affect overall shape plot dramatically - bars may shrink grow, even pop existence (see left-plot bottom row). may impact parts plot - see top y-axis limits changes across plots. Thus, want implement selection linked barplot dodging, tough choice whether make axes react response selection . make axes reactive user always able see data, however, selection happens, axis limits reset lose context provide. don’t make axes reactive, risk bars growing outside plotting area. don’t worry case stacked barplot since selection affect height tallest bar.
